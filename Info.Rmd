## Introduction to the A13 Traffic Forecasting App v.0.5.
- The main functionality of this app is to gain insight into the A13 Traffic Database and to predict the average speed of traffic on the A13.
- A13 is an important motorway connecting The Hague and Rotterdam.
- In 2011 TNO conducted a research on the traffic on this highway.
- Numbers of cars per minute (flow) as well as average speed were measured using "loops" placed inside the road.
- We will look at the average speed of the traffic along the highway at a given day.
- The data shown is from the traffic coming from The Hague and going to Rotterdam.
- There were 143 points of measurement along this side of the A13.
- This application only considers the measurements made in the first of half of 2011 due to data upload restrictions.
