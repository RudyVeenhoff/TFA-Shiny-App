## Forecast

**Details**

- Gives a prediction for the average speed of the traffic per time of day at a given *hectometerpaal*. It treats the data as a time series and uses a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure (stl) for forecasting. Only measurements in the previous week are used in the forecasting algorithm.

**Produces:** 

-  A plot with on the x-axis the time of day in "HH:MM" format and on the y-axis the average speed of the traffic in kilometres per hour.

**Parameters:**

- Date: The day to plot on x-axis. Ranges from 2011-01-08 to 2011-06-30. 
- Location: The location of the *hectometerpaal*. A *hectometerpaal* is the Dutch equivalent of the mile marker with a seperation of 100 meters. I.e. between *hectometerpaal* 75 and 75.1 there is 100 meter highway.
- Observed Speed: Overlay the plot with actual average speed of the traffic.
